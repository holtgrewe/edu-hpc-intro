__Advantages__

- fast execution of complex computational tasks
- process and analyze large data sets
- fast and large storage systems
- [MORE POWER]{.fragment .highlight-red} 🦾
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
__Drawbacks__

- learning curve / entry barrier
- usually shared with other users
- expensive to buy/operate
- high power usage/CO<sub>2</sub> footprint ([reference](https://www.bcs.org/articles-opinion-and-research/carbon-footprint-the-not-so-hidden-cost-of-high-performance-computing/))

__So far__

- have you benefited from advantages?
- have you suffered from drawbacks?

__From here on__

- what do you hope to gain from using HPC?
- what risks do you see?

## HPC Systems and Architecture  {.inverse background-color="#70ADC1"}

- Compute nodes
- Shared memory vs. distributed memory systems
- Cluster architecture
- Distributed file systems
- Job schedulers and resource management

⚠️ "Warning": just a quick and superficial overview ;-)

## Compute Nodes (1)

"Same-same (as your laptop), but different."

::::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.incremental}

- 2+ sockets with
    - many-cores CPUs
    - e.g., 2 x 24 x 2 = 96 threads
- high memory (e.g., 200+ GB)
- fast network interface card
    - "legacy": 10GbE (x2)
    - modern: 25GbE (x2)

- local disks
    - HDD or solid state SSD/NVME

## Compute Nodes (2)

More differences from "consumer-grade" hardware:

::: {.incremental}

- error correcting memory (bit flips are real)
  - [Google in 2009](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~bianca/papers/sigmetrics09.pdf): 8% of DIMMs have 1+ 1bit errors/year, 0.2% of DIMMs have 1+ 2bit errors/year
- stronger fans
- redundant power control
- redundant disks

## Shared vs. Distributed Memory {.even-smaller}

::::: {.incremental}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
__Shared Memory__

- in-core/multi-threading

```{mermaid}
graph BT
    sq1[thread 1] --> ci(memory address)
    sq2[thread 2] --> ci(memory address)
```

- ➕ low overhead
- ➕ easy to get started
- ➖ implicit communication, easy to make errors
- ➖ do you __really__ understand your memory model?

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
__Distributed Memory__

- out-of-core/message-passing

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    sq1[thread 1] -->|How are you?| sq2[thread 2]
    sq2[thread 2] -->|- fine, thank!| sq1[thread 1]
```

- ➕ explicit communication, fewer wrong assumptions(?)
- ➕ model scales up better for larger systems
- ➖ harder to get started
- ➖ more complex primitives

  memory parallelism before?

## Cluster Architecture

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

- head nodes (login/transfer)
- compute nodes
    - generic: cpu
    - specialized: high-mem/gpus
- storage cluster with parallel file system
- scheduler to orchestrate jobs
- __Network/Interconnect__

## Distributed File Systems (1)

__"Same-same (as your laptop), but different."__

- POSIX file system
  - laptop: ext4/XFS/btrfs/ZFS/...
  - distributed: CephFS, GPFS/SpectrumScale, BeeGFS, ...
- POSIX guarantees
  - `sync()` &rarr; visible everywhere
  - `mkdir`/`open()` &rarr; visible everywhere
  - files can be opened by multiple processes
- ... harder to enforce in a distributed (multi-node) setting

## Distributed File Systems (2)

**Best Practices / Do's & Don'ts**

- use modest sized directories (<10k entries)
  - don't create one file per gene (or similar)
  - create sub directories, e.g., `abcdef` &rarr; `ab/cdef`
- don't splurge in file count
  - don't create one file per NGS read (or similar)
- avoid recursive traversal of large structures
  - `ls -lR` will be slow!

## Distributed File Systems (3)

**Best Practices / Do's & Don'ts**

- avoid small reads/writes and random access
  - each I/O operation (IOP) needs to go through the network
  - I/O systems are better at handling larger/sequential reads/writes
- **DO** stream through your files
  - `for each line/record in file: # do work`
- **DO** use Unix `sort`
- **DO** use Unix pipelines rather than temporary files
  - e.g., `seqtk mergepe R1.fq R2.fq | bwa mem ref.fa | samtools sort | samtools view -O out.bam`

## Job Scheduler and Resource Management

```{mermaid}

    autonumber
    User-)+Scheduler: sbatch $resource_args jobscript.sh
    Scheduler->>+Scheduler: add job to queue
    User-)+Scheduler: squeue / scontrol show job
    Scheduler-->>+User: job status
    Note right of Scheduler: scheduler loop
    Scheduler-)Compute Node: start job
    Compute Node->>Compute Node: execute job
    Compute Node-)+Scheduler: job complete
```
